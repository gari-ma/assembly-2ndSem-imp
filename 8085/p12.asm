; A set of eight data bytes (4 Pairs) are stored in memory locations starting from 1040H. WAP
; to add two bytes at a time and store the sum in same memory location, sum replacing the first
; byte and the carry replacing the second byte. If any pair does not generate a carry, the
; memory location of the second byte should be cleared i.e. store 00H over there
